# PicoBoy
🎮 PicoBoy Game (Designed Using C)

This project presents a new handheld game for PicoBoy, developed entirely using C++ and designed to run on the RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico) microcontroller. The game is built with a focus on performance, low-level hardware control, and efficient memory usage, making full use of the RP2040’s capabilities.

The game logic, graphics rendering, and input handling are implemented in bare-metal C++, without relying on heavy game engines. Physical push buttons provide precise and responsive controls, while a compact OLED display is used to render game visuals in real time.

The C++ architecture is modular, separating:

Game logic

Input handling

Display rendering

Hardware abstraction

This makes the project easy to expand with new levels, animations, or gameplay mechanics. The entire system is fully wired, USB-powered, and designed for reliability and educational value.
